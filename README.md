# Module 6 Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

- This weather forecast app lets users obtain current weather data as well as a 5-day forecast.
- The weather data is sourced from OpenWeatherMap's API.
- Building this application enhanced my understanding of RESTful APIs and the intricacies of CSS.

## Installation

No installation is needed. Just visit the [live site](https://joseperez013.github.io/weather-dashboard/). 

## Usage

Upon loading the page, you'll be greeted by the main interface of the weather forecast application.

To fetch weather data, simply type in your desired city in the designated search bar.

Once a city is searched, the application displays the current weather information and a 5-day forecast.

Did you refresh the page by accident? No worries! Every searched city is saved to local storage, ensuring you don't lose your data. For a quick forecast lookup, just click on one of the previously searched cities.
